## Planet

Vetoo 581d, or Vetoo III, is the third planet from the main sequence
star Vetoo. It orbits its host star in roughly 400 days, and orbits
its own axis in roughly 30 hours. The planet itself once had a moon,
but it got torn apart by the
[tidal forces of the planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit).
The rocks that once were Vetoo IIIb now orbit the planet in a ring.

## Environment

Although the planets gravity is close to that of the earth, it's
atmosphere is toxic to humans. The high concentration of carbon
dioxide, compared to the low volumes of oxygen makes the planet
hostile to all land based life forms.

The large salt water oceans on the planet are filled with animals and
plants. Large fresh water lakes and rivers can be found on the land
which house a wide diaspora of animals and plants.

## Thunderstorms

The planet is plagued by large (often hundres of kilometres in radius)
thunderstorms that ravage the land. These storms destroy almost
anything in their path, and the only save way to hide is to go
underground. As long as those thunderstorms rage, communication
through radio is blocked or hindered.

Those storms come with hail that is potentially lethal to humans, rain
and drops temperatures below freezing point.

## Acidic Geysers

Since the planet is still very active, in terms of seismic activity,
it is covered in geysers that spew forth hot acidic water.

## Mudpots

Mudpots are hot springs with limited access to fresh water. Micro
organisms break down the hydrogen sulphide as an energy source and
covert it into sulphuric acid. The acid then breaks down the rock
into clay, making these hot springs look like a puddle of cooking
mud.

## Flora

No plants grow on the land surface of the planet. Although a wide
variety of plants, including green plants that perform photosynthesis,
can be found in lakes and the ocean.

## Fauna

Although the planet has already developed a wide variety of animals
in the ocean and fresh water streams and lakes, there are no land
animals on Vetoo 581d.
