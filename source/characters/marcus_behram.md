Marcus Behram was one of the pilots of the Precursor. He served under
Lt. Andrea Gord, along with three other co pilots. Freshly trained from
the flight school he is still considered a rookie pilot. Markus covers
his insecurities as a rookie pilot with loads of sarcasm. He is rather
short, 1.65, has short black hair and brown eyes.
