# Ship: Precursor

Lead by the scientist [Mark Dubois](/characters/Mark_Dubois.md), the Precursor
is under the flag of the company 
[Arstir Industries](/faction/Arstir_industries.md).

## Background

The ship left earth 2154 to get more detailed informations if life is really
possible on the planet [Vetoo 581d](/planets/vetoo_581d.md). The science crew
assigned to it managed to get the habitats and a comms array operational. The
last message earth received from them stated, that violent thunderstorms made
communications over long periods of time impossible. Nobody has heared anything
from them since then.
