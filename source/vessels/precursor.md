Lead by the scientist [Mark Dubois](../characters/mark_dubois.html),
the Precursor is under the flag of the company
[Arstir Industries](../factions/arstir_industries.html).

## Background

The ship left earth 2154 to get more detailed informations if life is really
possible on the planet [Vetoo 581d](../planets/vetoo_581d.html). The
science crew assigned to it managed to get the habitats and a comms array
operational. The last message earth received from them stated, that violent
thunderstorms made communications over long periods of time impossible. Nobody
has heared anything from them since then.
