This page lists an overview of all available perks.

## Natural Armour

The creature has some sort of natural, inherit armour that protects
its flesh and vital organs. A number must be listed along with the
perk (if none is listed, 1 is assumed). This number gives the creature
a protection against incoming damage up to the specified amount. Any
incoming damage is reduced by the natural armour value, before the
damage is applied to **Endurance** or **Health**. This also applies to
critical damage.

## Bite Attack

This means that a creature has a particularly deadly bite attack.
This perk comes with an additional dice or numnber, specifying the
damage this attack does. If none is specified one damage is
assumed. Everytime before it attacks in melee it has to specify what
natural weapon is used. If the attack deals damage, it deals a
specific amount of damage as supplied with the perk. The perk can be
neutralised, and rendered unasable through certain conditions. For
example, a dog with a muzzle might not be able to use its bite attack
to deal damage to an opponent.

## Claws

This means that a creature has a set of particular deadly claws. This
perk comes with an additional dice or number, specifying the damage
this attack does. If none is specified, one damage is
assumed. Everytime before the creature attacks in melee it has to
specify what natural weapon is used (in case there are more than
one). If the attack deals damage, it deals a specific amount of damage
as supplied by the perk.  The perk can be neutralised, and rendered
unasable through certain conditions. For example, a declawed cat
cannot use its claws to scratch anyone.
