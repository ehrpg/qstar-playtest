Raptors are race of bipedal, feathered predators native to
[Veeto 581](../planets/vetoo_581d).

## Description

They stand roughly one and a half metre high, and are covered in short
feathers. Although they are birds, they are incapable of flight. They
have a large beak with sharp teeth they use for hunting. Raptors live
primarily in the large forests covering the planet, and prey upon smaller
birds and their eggs. They hunt in packs, but are also known to appear
alone. Raptors will fight to procure food, but will attempt to flee if
their prey is stronger than anticipated. To protect their eggs however,
they will fight to the bitter end.
