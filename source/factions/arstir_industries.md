Arstir Industries is the largest conglomerate on Earth. The principal
divisions of the compare are *space, transport and colonisation*
(Arstir Frontiers) and *security and defence* (Arstir Security). The
company is a prominent maker of space vessels, both for military and
civilian use.

## Invention of FTL

Arstir industries revolutionised space travel in 2089 when it invented
a drive that allowed a vessel to accelerate to faster than the speed
of causality (*c*). This, in combination with the already invented cryo
pod for humans, allowed mankind to travel to distant stars and planets.

## Colonisation

In 2120 the company was awarded a contract by the United Nations of
Earth to develop and build colony ships to create the first colonies
in distant star systems.
